# Churn Prediction  -  Predictive Modeling

The purpose of this project is to develop the whole pipeline that is required to develop machine learning models that can predict churn of wireless telephony customers of a telecom in Latin America.

## Remarks on the code provided

Together with this report we provide two Jupyter notebooks:
*  Data PreProcessing and Exploration.ipynb : This notebook contains the code for the data prep-processing, exploration, and visualization.
*  Model Testing and HyperParameter Tunning.ipynb : This notebook shows the training phase of our pipeline. It also includes the code for hyper-parameter tuning of several models and our feature selection strategies.
*  An anonymized train and test dataset.
*  A report with insights about the ML project

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.5
* Scikit-Learn


### How to run?

Just Launch the Jupyter Notebooks

## Parameters


## Output

The program will return a file named Output.xml with all possible duplicate pairs.
