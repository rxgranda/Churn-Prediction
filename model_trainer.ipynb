      "|\" when ! \" that have what i say when i finish directorate s. it have a doorstop of a book . to be fair , the author , steve col , be a top-notch journalist , who cover south asia for decade . he have work for publication such as the washington post and the new yorker . he understand the culture ( and foible ) of powerful americans , and he have a great feel for bureaucratic inanity . but directorate s be not really a history of the war in afghanistan . instead , it have a mountainous mishmash of recycle journalism . some of it be superbly report . some of it be ephemeral trivia . but all of it lean heavily on storytelling service such as vignette , anecdote , reconstruct conversation , and the story of individual ( usually high official ) . the narrative often blur as the report jump back and forth between the cia , iaf , the white house , the state department , karzai have presidency , and pakistan have isi . insider political gossip abound : obama dislike richard holbrooke ; zal khalizad be an operator glue to he cellphone ; karzai see conspiracy everywhere ; isi director be chainsmokers ; cia contractor be scum ; benazir bhutto be a drama queen , and so forth . material like this get old after 300 page or so , especially when the reader have expectation have be raise by the heft of the book . incredibly , afghanistan itself get leave out of the story . directorate s have little to say about afghan politics , village culture , tribal network , government institution , or economy ( except for opium production ) . likewise , the u.s. ground war get short shrift ( one chapter ) , though cia counterterrorism operation be well-covered . also barely mention be the huge ( and frequently unsuccessful ) international effort to build afghanistan have institution and economy , no doubt because usaid and the world bank be not as sexy as the cia , even though they be vastly more consequential , especially when they fail . what ambitious reporter want to cover usaid ? i enjoy directorate s because i work in kabul and have first-hand knowledge of a few of the people and event discuss in the book . everything in it ring true , especially the picture of u.s. policy as perpetually adrift , distract , and unsure of how to manage afghanistan at an acceptable cost . in the end , however , directorate s be a long slog through col have year of report on bit and piece of the war , cull from source will to be interview . ( he apparently have great access to the obama white house than the bush white house . ) alas , do the job of journalism -- even great journalism -- do not always lead a reporter to the material need need for a comprehensive and well-documented work of history or political science . directorate s be not such a work .|positive |0.0           |\n",

If you watched the excellent multi-part National Geographic Channel documentary on 9/11, you will get a great deal out of this book.\\n\\nAs a radio broadcaster who was on the air the moment the second plane hit, and with a newly-adopted 2 year old daughter, 9/11 resonates with me, as I'm sure it does everyone.
